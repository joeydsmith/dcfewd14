##FEWD GitHub work flow for student submissions

###Purpose of this document

- Students should be able to describe their homework submission process using GitHub
- Instructional team should be able to describe how students will be assessed using a simple numeric scale
- Instructional team should be able to explain how GitHub will be used for student feedback with their instructional team

##Student Submission

Students should submit homework via GitHub using the techniques taught in [this lesson](Week_00_GitHub/README.md)

* Depending on the homework, students will either create a new repository with the project name or contribute to an existing repo. 
* They should commit all of their files when they are ready for the instructional team's review.
* All changes should be submitted to a master branch - we will not ask students to branch, merge, or create pull requests in this course. 
* After publishing their changes, students should submit a link to the repository to the Instructional Team via email and/or the class Schoology page. 

##Instructional Review

There is a two-part process for homework / project review outlined below. We recommend having the instructional team break the class into equal groups for grading with EIRs (expert in residence), with each EIR grading the same group of students, week to week.

###Part 1: Code Review

The most important part of the homework process is giving feedback on students' code quality and application of skills. We will use GitHub's in-line commenting system to share this feedback.

* For a particular homework / project, open up a student's repository
* Go to the "Commits" tab. Most students will have a single commit. If students have a couple commits, you may want to review multiple commits. 
* To provide your feedback, click on the final commit
* Review the code and use GitHub in-line commenting for feedback. Aim to make at least 3 comments on every assignment: two things you liked - with one comment for each - and one comment where a line or block of code could be improved. Also, feel free to note any additional issues with their code using in-line comments. For students that are doing well this may be limited. However, for students who are struggling on a section, this is a great opportunity to reinforce solutions to issues: students tend to make the same mistakes throughout their codebase.
    - An example of a comment showing one thing you liked: "Your code is nicely commented!  I was easily able to follow what you were trying to do here."
    - An example of a comment showing one thing you *didn't* like: "You rewrote this anonymous function three different times.  Think about how could have declared a function and called that function in different places instead rewriting that script each time."
* Students will receive notifications of the feedback via GitHub.


###Part 2: Grading

While the qualitative feedback on an assignment's code review is critical, we do need to provide a numerical grade for student work. For each homework / project description, use the [Technical Requirements](#) section as a rubric and assess student work by grading each technical requirement on a scale that you and your instructional team prefer.  We recommend the following:

Use a 0 - 2 point scale where:

* *2 points* when a technical requirement exceeds expectations
* *1 point* when a technical requirement meets expectations
* *0 points* when a technical requirement does not meet expectations.

The total potential raw score should be calculated using the total number of technical requirements for a project / homework and multiplying it by two.  For example, if a homework assignment has 10 technical requirements, then the maximum number of points a student can earn is 20. Student homework / project grades should be posted on Schoology for each individual student for each project.
